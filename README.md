### Raspberry Pi Blinky Bus Approaching Indicator

Raspberry Pi blinks LED when local bus is approaching stop.

Blinks slower when you've got time to walk, faster when you should run.

#### This uses the 511.org real time API:

Get 511.org API info and tokens here:

To find stop codes use their stop code lookup tool (Direction is implicit in code):

<http://transit.511.org/schedules/realtimedepartures.aspx#enable=stopidlookup>

I also found stop codes for AC Transit here:
